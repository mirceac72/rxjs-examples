# RxJS Usage Patterns

The repository contains a set of RxJS usage patterns which, if not well understood, can make a programmer to spend a couple of hours debugging. 

## How to run the examples

Compile the typescript files using

> npm run tsc

The resulting Javascript files will be stored into ./dist folder.

Run a specific Javascript file using

> node ./dist/javascript-file-name

The examples were tested with Node.js 11.14.0
